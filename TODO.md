- Can I make the toggle buttons work without javascript?
- Can I ANIMATE the non standard div shape?
- Can I find a pixel art font that is monospace AND has exact pixel height including whitespace AND each character is an even number of pixels wide when counting the gap between them? I need this if I ever want to center text using `text-align: center` and have it align with the pixel grid regardless of the number of characters in the text.
- Put more pixel art everywhere!
- Add explanations of the techiques I used to THIS website!

- ~~Investigate drawing a pixel grid across the entire page, so I can verify that pixel alignment/size is being correctly maintained~~
- ~~Play around with non-standard div shapes. Can I get a pixelated shape that only hovers when my mouse goes over the pixel?~~
- ~~Can I get pixelated div motion working? Standard animation will probably look too smooth and will drag pixels into subpixels, losing crispness~~
- ~~Can I get pixel art images to display properly when at a pixel scale of 1x1? Normally the trick is to scale it up to 44 or 8x8 per pixel, but that's ass.~~
- ~~Add a link to github~~
