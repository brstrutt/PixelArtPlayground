- ~~Investigate drawing a pixel grid across the entire page, so I can verify that pixel alignment/size is being correctly maintained~~
- Play around with non-standard div shapes. Can I get a pixelated shape that only hovers when my mouse goes over the pixel?
- Can I get pixelated div motion working? Standard animation will probably look too smooth and will drag pixels into subpixels, losing crispness
- Can I get pixel art images to display properly when at a pixel scale of 1x1? Normally the trick is to scale it up to 44 or 8x8 per pixel, but that's ass.
- Put more pixel art everywhere!
- Add explanations of the techiques I used to THIS website!
