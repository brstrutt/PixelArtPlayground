## Description

A small website to see if it is possible to create a responsive website that looks like pixel art.

## Development

I recommend using VSCode and installing the "LiverServer" extension from the extension suggestions.
Then you can just right click the `index.html` and select "Open with live server" to see the website. Then just refresh it to see any changes you have made.
