## Description

A small website to see if it is possible to create a responsive website that looks like pixel art.

To see the current site, visit [https://brstrutt.github.io/PixelArtPlayground/](https://brstrutt.github.io/PixelArtPlayground/).

## Development

I recommend using VSCode and installing the "LiverServer" extension from the extension suggestions.
Then you can just right click the `index.html` and select "Open with live server" to see the website. Then just refresh it to see any changes you have made.

## Deployment

It automatically deploys to github pages when `main` is pushed.
Since it's just HTML/CSS no build is required. Github pages just serves the current state of the `main` branch as is.
